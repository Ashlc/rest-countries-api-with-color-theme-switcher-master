## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - For countries data
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For routing
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type checking
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - For build tooling
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - For icons

### What I learned

Overall it wasn't too difficult to implement the features required for this challenge. The most challenging part was probably the theming, which I had fiddled with before but never implemented in a project. I also generally use component libraries like PrimeReact, so it was nice to build components from scratch. I mostly exercised my TypeScript skills in this project, which I'm still learning, as well as folder structure and organization.

### Continued development

I want to focus on acessibility in my next projects. I often go the easy route and don't implement things like keyboard navigation or screen reader support. For this project specifically, I would like to add a11y features like aria labels and keyboard navigation, which might be challenging as my inputs are custom and not native HTML inputs.

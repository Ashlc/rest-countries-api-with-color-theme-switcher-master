## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - For countries data
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For routing
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type checking
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - For build tooling
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - For icons

### What I learned

Overall it wasn't too difficult to implement the features required for this challenge. The most challenging part was probably the theming, which I had fiddled with before but never implemented in a project. I also generally use component libraries like PrimeReact, so it was nice to build components from scratch. I mostly exercised my TypeScript skills in this project, which I'm still learning, as well as folder structure and organization.

### Continued development

I want to focus on acessibility in my next projects. I often go the easy route and don't implement things like keyboard navigation or screen reader support. For this project specifically, I would like to add a11y features like aria labels and keyboard navigation, which might be challenging as my inputs are custom and not native HTML inputs.
